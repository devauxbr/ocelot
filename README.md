# OCELOT
## The best way to communicate java and javascript 

Ocelot framework allow to call differents services directly from simple classes methods call, like you can do in the backend.

Ocelot allow to implement the Message driven bean paragdim but for javascript with topic destination.
For push message/object to the client.

Ocelot use one bidirection connection websocket.

The better way, is doing EJB annotated, but you can call a simple pojo, or soon spring bean.
